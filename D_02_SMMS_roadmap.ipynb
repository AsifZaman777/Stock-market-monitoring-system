    "## Stock Market Monitoring System (SMMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Define Objectives\n",
    "The primary goal is to detect market manipulation and fraudulent activities such as:\n",
    "- **Pump and Dump Schemes:** Artificially inflating stock prices and then selling off.\n",
    "- **Wash Trading:** Simultaneously buying and selling the same stock to create false volume.\n",
    "- **Insider Trading:** Trading based on non-public, material information.\n",
    "- **Circular Trading:** Repeated buying and selling among the same group of traders.\n",
    "- **Spoofing:** Placing fake orders to manipulate prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Data Collection\n",
    "You need structured and clean data for analysis. Key datasets include:\n",
    "- **Historical Trade Data:**\n",
    "  Timestamps, prices, volumes, buyer/seller IDs, and order types (buy/sell).\n",
    "- ~~**Order Book Data:**\n",
    "  Bid/ask prices, order sizes, and market depth.~~\n",
    "- **Company Fundamentals:**\n",
    "  Financial statements, news, and announcements.\n",
    "- **Market-Wide Data:**\n",
    "  Index movements, sector performance, and macroeconomic indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "- **Clean the Data:** Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.\n",
    "- **Normalize Data:** Adjust for stock splits, dividends, and other corporate actions.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "  - Create features like price volatility, volume spikes, order imbalances, and trade-to-order ratios.\n",
    "  - Calculate metrics like moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and Bollinger Bands for technical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Build the Surveillance System\n",
    "#### Key Components:\n",
    "1. **Anomaly Detection:**\n",
    "   Use machine learning models like Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, or One-Class SVM to identify unusual trading patterns.\n",
    "   *Example:* Detect sudden spikes in volume or price that deviate from historical norms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pattern Recognition:**\n",
    "   Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to group similar trading patterns.\n",
    "   *Example:* Identify groups of traders repeatedly trading the same stock (circular trading).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sentiment Analysis:**\n",
    "   Analyze news and social media to detect pump-and-dump schemes.\n",
    "   *Example:* Correlate sudden price movements with positive news or rumors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rule-Based Alerts:**\n",
    "   Set thresholds for key metrics (e.g., volume spikes > 500%, price changes > 10% in 5 minutes).\n",
    "   *Example:* Flag trades that exceed these thresholds for further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Tools and Technologies\n",
    "- **Programming Languages:** Python (preferred for data science) or R.\n",
    "- **Libraries:**\n",
    "  - Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy.\n",
    "  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.\n",
    "  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.\n",
    "- **Database:** SQL or NoSQL for storing and querying large datasets.\n",
    "- **Dashboard:** Use tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Dash for real-time monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Generate Insights and Visualizations\n",
    "To generate an image or visualization, focus on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Heatmap of Suspicious Activities:**\n",
    "   Create a heatmap showing the frequency of flagged activities (e.g., volume spikes, price manipulation) over time.\n",
    "   *Example:* X-axis = Time, Y-axis = Stocks, Color Intensity = Suspicion Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trader Network Graph:**\n",
    "   Visualize the network of traders, highlighting clusters of suspicious activity.\n",
    "   *Example:* Nodes = Traders, Edges = Trades, Color = Suspicion Level.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Series Analysis:**\n",
    "   Plot price and volume movements for specific stocks, highlighting anomalies.\n",
    "   *Example:* Overlay flagged events (e.g., pump-and-dump) on the stock's price chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dashboard for Real-Time Monitoring:**\n",
    "   Build an interactive dashboard showing real-time alerts, suspicious trades, and market trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Deployment\n",
    "- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Integrate the system with the **LankaBangla** trading platform for real-time alerts.\n",
    "- **Fraud rate calculation** Measure the manipulation rate and before placing orders by investor/dealer. e.g: Spoofing rate (87%), insider trading rate (12%)\n",
    "- **Investor awareness** Train investor to be aware of investing on the manipulated stocks\n",
