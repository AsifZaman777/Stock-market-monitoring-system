# Stock Market Monitoring System

## Step 1: Define Objectives
The primary goal is to detect market manipulation and fraudulent activities such as:
- **Pump and Dump Schemes:** Artificially inflating stock prices and then selling off.
- **Wash Trading:** Simultaneously buying and selling the same stock to create false volume.
- **Insider Trading:** Trading based on non-public, material information.
- **Circular Trading:** Repeated buying and selling among the same group of traders.
- **Spoofing:** Placing fake orders to manipulate prices.

## Step 2: Data Collection
You need structured and clean data for analysis. Key datasets include:
- **Historical Trade Data:**  
  Timestamps, prices, volumes, buyer/seller IDs, and order types (buy/sell).
- ~~**Order Book Data:**  
  Bid/ask prices, order sizes, and market depth.~~
- **Company Fundamentals:**  
  Financial statements, news, and announcements.
- **Market-Wide Data:**  
  Index movements, sector performance, and macroeconomic indicators.

## Step 3: Data Preprocessing
- **Clean the Data:** Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Normalize Data:** Adjust for stock splits, dividends, and other corporate actions.
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Create features like price volatility, volume spikes, order imbalances, and trade-to-order ratios.
  - Calculate metrics like moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and Bollinger Bands for technical analysis.

## Step 4: Build the Surveillance System
### Key Components:
1. **Anomaly Detection:**  
   Use machine learning models like Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, or One-Class SVM to identify unusual trading patterns.  
   *Example:* Detect sudden spikes in volume or price that deviate from historical norms.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**  
   Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to group similar trading patterns.  
   *Example:* Identify groups of traders repeatedly trading the same stock (circular trading).

3. **Network Analysis:**  
   Build a trader network graph to detect collusion or coordinated trading.  
   *Example:* Identify clusters of traders who frequently trade with each other.

4. **Sentiment Analysis:**  
   Analyze news and social media to detect pump-and-dump schemes.  
   *Example:* Correlate sudden price movements with positive news or rumors.

5. **Rule-Based Alerts:**  
   Set thresholds for key metrics (e.g., volume spikes > 500%, price changes > 10% in 5 minutes).  
   *Example:* Flag trades that exceed these thresholds for further investigation.

## Step 5: Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python (preferred for data science) or R.
- **Libraries:**  
  - Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy.  
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.  
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.  
  - Network Analysis: NetworkX.  
- **Database:** SQL or NoSQL for storing and querying large datasets.
- **Dashboard:** Use tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Dash for real-time monitoring.

## Step 6: Generate Insights and Visualizations
To generate an image or visualization, focus on the following:

1. **Heatmap of Suspicious Activities:**  
   Create a heatmap showing the frequency of flagged activities (e.g., volume spikes, price manipulation) over time.  
   *Example:* X-axis = Time, Y-axis = Stocks, Color Intensity = Suspicion Score.

2. **Trader Network Graph:**  
   Visualize the network of traders, highlighting clusters of suspicious activity.  
   *Example:* Nodes = Traders, Edges = Trades, Color = Suspicion Level.

3. **Time Series Analysis:**  
   Plot price and volume movements for specific stocks, highlighting anomalies.  
   *Example:* Overlay flagged events (e.g., pump-and-dump) on the stock's price chart.

4. **Dashboard for Real-Time Monitoring:**  
   Build an interactive dashboard showing real-time alerts, suspicious trades, and market trends.

## Step 7: Deployment
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Integrate the system with the brokerage's trading platform for real-time alerts.
- **Reporting:** Automate the generation of reports for regulatory compliance (e.g., BSEC).
- **Feedback Loop:** Continuously update the models with new data to improve accuracy.
